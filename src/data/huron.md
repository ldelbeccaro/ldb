As an Analyst in the Healthcare practice at Huron, I worked with hospitals and medical groups to optimize their revenue cycle processes. I worked with millions of patient records to find trends among providers, patients and payers to recover as much money as possible for clients.
<br><br>
On one project in particular, I uncovered $9M of potential revenue for a client by building a query to link insurance coverage information among patient accounts from three different Hospital Information Systems (HIS), collectively holding over one million patient medical records.
