As a Software Engineer at First Round, I worked on a team of 3 to build <a href="http://search.firstround.com" target="_blank">First Search</a> - the largest database of curated tech advice - from scratch. The project included building a machine learning tagging system to tag content both as tactical/not and with categories, a scraper for new content ingestion, and a Rails/React/Redux app that uses Algolia for client-side search.

I also contributed to First Round Network, a Q&A platform (built on Rails) for employees of portfolio companies that helps with knowledge sharing across First Round companies of all sizes.
