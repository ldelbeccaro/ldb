I have been closely involved with the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco on their NextGen Leadership Council for some time, and have most recently been working with the President, Board and Marketing team to redo their website.
<br><br>
The team previously used a very clunky Wordpress builder & template that broke completely when they wanted to switch styles. I helped them select a new tool (<a href="http://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow</a>) that optimized for sustainability and maintainability - so their team could continue to make edits when the bulk of my initial work was completed.
