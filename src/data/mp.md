I joined Mixpanel as a Sales Engineer, where I worked with customers both pre- and post-sales to help them understand the technical aspects of Mixpanel, implement tracking code, perform complex data manipulations or build custom reports, etc. I also built an internal tool for the sales and sales engineering teams that is still used by every entering employee during onboarding, and used for every customer demo. It allows employees to create custom datasets and send that data to Mixpanel in minutes, so that all customer demos are specifically tailored to their businesses.

A little after a year in, I interviewed to be a Software Engineer and joined the People Analytics team. <a href="https://mixpanel.com/people/" target="_blank">People Analytics</a> allows customers to engage with their users via email, push, SMS, and more. I worked on both our notifications infrastructure (Python) and customer-facing application (Django/<a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/panel" target="_blank">Panel</a>).
