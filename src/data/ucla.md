I graduated from UCLA in 2013 with a major in Mathematics/Economics and a minor in Spanish.
<br><br>
I was the VP Finance on the National Panhellenic Council, received honors from the Sigma Theta National Honor Society and Order of Omega Greek Leadership Honor Society, and participated in UCLA Club Tennis (National Champions in 2011), UCLA Spring Sing, and Dance Marathon.
<br><br>
I also cofounded Green the Greek at UCLA, an organization devoted to increasing ecological awareness and promoting sustainability in all Greek houses on the UCLA campus.
