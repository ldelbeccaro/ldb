I'm a software engineer currently working on a problem in the new hire onboarding space. Are your team members and/or new hires performing a ton of tedious tasks when people start at your company? Have any questions about onboarding or think your process could be improved? <a href="mailto:laura@lauradelbeccaro.com" target="_blank">Contact me.</a>
